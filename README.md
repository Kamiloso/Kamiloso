# Projects I have Already Finished

## Maze Game
A university project written in C++ for Windows. Itâ€™s a console game where you fight enemies in a maze and try to achieve the highest score possible.

## Space Eternity 3
My flagship Unity project. In this game, you explore a procedurally generated world while managing your inventory, with the main goal being to fight and defeat bosses. The game also features an online multiplayer mode.

## SE3 website
I created the [se3.page](https://se3.page/) website for Space Eternity 3 using Docosaurus. It includes a download page, instructions for running the game, and documentation for datapacks.
