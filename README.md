## Space Eternity 3
My flagship Unity project. In this game, you explore a procedurally generated world while managing your inventory, with the main goal being to fight and defeat bosses.
The game also features an online multiplayer mode. [Check repository](https://github.com/Space-Eternity-3/Space-Eternity-3).

I have written a website for Space Eternity 3 with [Nadwey](https://github.com/Nadwey/) (the creator of the SE3 Launcher) using Docusaurus. It includes a download page, instructions for running the game, and documentation for datapacks.
[Check repository](https://github.com/Space-Eternity-3/SE3-Website) or see the website [here](https://se3.page).
