## Space Eternity 3
My flagship Unity project. In this game, you explore a procedurally generated world while managing your inventory, with the main goal being to fight and defeat bosses. The game also features an online multiplayer mode.

## SE3 website
I have written a website for Space Eternity 3 with [Nadwey](https://github.com/Nadwey/) (the creator of the SE3 Launcher) using Docusaurus. It includes a download page, instructions for running the game, and documentation for datapacks. See it [here](https://se3.page).
